# PyPI Publication Plan for "pyUSPTO"

This is a comprehensive plan to prepare the USPTO ODP API client for PyPI publication under the name "pyUSPTO".

## Current Status

- Package name in `setup.py` is now "pyUSPTO"
- Version is updated to "0.1.2" in both `setup.py` and `__init__.py`
- Old files have been cleaned out
- Basic project structure is in place
- Duplicate exception definitions fixed
- Version synchronization implemented

## Items for Immediate Action

### Items for Cline to Fix

1. **Documentation Setup**:

   - Set up Sphinx documentation as mentioned in the README
   - Create a `docs/` directory with proper structure

### Items for Manual Completion

4. **Git Tagging**: Create a process for tagging releases that aligns with the version in the code.

5. **Packaging Configuration**: Enhance `pyproject.toml` with more metadata and build system configuration.

## Items for Future Consideration

1. **Type Checking**: Add a mypy configuration file to enforce type checking.

2. **Read the Docs Integration**: Set up documentation hosting on Read the Docs.

3. **Contributing Guidelines**: Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors.

4. **Changelog**: Consider adding a CHANGELOG.md file to track version changes, which provides benefits beyond GitHub releases:
   - Accessible to users who download from PyPI without visiting GitHub
   - Documentation that stays with the codebase
   - More detailed explanations than typical in commit messages
   - Historical record when browsing the repository files
